# Connect4App
Simple Connect 4 App written with vanilla ES6 classes that manipulate the DOM and SVG objects.

Right-left arrow keys move tokens, down arrow key drops token.

I wrote game logic and code to create the tokens and gameboard, initialize the game, take turns, and declare a winner.

Project guidlines, stylesheets, and SVG objects were provided by TeamTreehouse.
